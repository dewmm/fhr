<h3>
Why'd I Do That? The Stubbed Putt</h3>
The ground behind the ball, sending it halfway to the hole. You look down at the green, you examine the putter, you shake your head. But everyone knows... you stubbed it.<br />
<br />
Usually the stub comes from making a backstroke that's too short, which forces you to really accelerate the putterhead coming through. This changes your rhythm and grip pressure. Look at Jason Day or Jordan Spieth: They take the putter back with consistent rhythm and sufficient length for the distance of the putt. Post-impact the stroke is firm, not loose. The left wrist is in line with the puttershaft.<br />

The key move is an unrushed transition from backstroke to through-stroke. No burst of speed at the ball. And be sure not to loop the putterhead to the inside or outside as you start the forward stroke. Re-routing can cause a stub. The ideal path is slightly to the inside going back, then along the line through impact, then slightly inside again.<br />
<h3>
HOW TO HEAD OFF PUTTING WOES</h3>
First, if you stub a putt, try not to get too embarrassed. It doesn’t happen very often, so just laugh it off and let it go. I assure you, golfers who saw it are not thinking the harsh things you think they’re thinking.<br />
Second, trust the design of your putter, and trust that gravity is working for you. Just make a stroke as if you were throwing a ball underhand—nice and smooth, back and through. Do that, and it will have plenty of length going back and generate enough power to get the putt to the hole. You won’t have to goose it on the way down.<br />
Third, develop a good pre-putt routine and make your routine more important than the outcome of the putt. I’m not so concerned about what you do in your routine, but make sure it’s easy enough to do the same way every time.<br />
The last thing is, beware of the stub on short putts, too. A lot of players roll a putt up to gimme range, then just slap at it. You’ve got to stay focused here. Don’t carelessly backhand even the shortest putt, unless you don’t mind missing ones you should have made. My experience tells me it’s easier to work on keeping your composure than it is to get used to missing short putts. —Bob Rotella, Ph.D.<br />
<h3>
Get On A Roll To Make More Putts</h3>
Working on your putting isn't the most exciting way to spend an afternoon, but on tour we know it's worth the effort. You can be playing amazing from tee to green, but if you aren't converting makable putts, you'll struggle with your confidence. Last year my ball-striking ranked 13th on tour, but I didn't putt well. The year before, I was exactly tour average in strokes gained with the putter but hit the ball worse. How'd I do? I won $2.1 million $600,000 more than last year.<br />
Each part of the game feeds off the others, but putting carries a lot of weight. No matter what you're working on with your stroke, you can roll it better if you build some consistency into your approach.<br />
After you pick a line, don't give yourself the chance to second-guess it when you're standing over the ball. I match up the line on my ball with the start line of my putt (above), then set up with the putterface perpendicular to that line. I set my grip and get my stance square to the line on the ball, not to the hole.<br />
Once I know I have the putterface aligned precisely, I make sure I'm relaxed and comfortable in my posture. Nothing should feel rigid, tight or flexed. When I practice, I use a mirror to make sure my eyes are positioned inside the ball, because that helps the putter swing on a curved arc, just like every other club. If you set your eyes directly over the ball, like a lot of players do, it throws off your perspective.<br />
Once my body is set, I don't waste any time. I'll take one more look at the target and then start my stroke (below).<br />
If you take that last look and don't see your line clearly or don't feel good about the stroke you're about to make, it's OK to back off and start over, just try not to make that a habit. Keep your routine brisk and make a few putts and you can be my partner anytime.&nbsp; With Matthew Rudy<br />
