Let's be clear: Either of these games would have made the top of the list. They're both wonderful experiences in their own way, and at the same time part of the same magical whole. Super Mario Galaxy 1 eases you into the planet-hopping gameplay, letting you enjoy the delightful visuals and fantastic soundtrack before hitting you hard with challenge in the back half. SMG2, on the other hand, has the benefit of assuming you've already played the first game; it quickly ramps up back to difficulty levels of the first game, then takes it a few steps further as the game progresses. These games would rank high on the Best Games of All-Time list, for any system; as it stands, they're by far the best games on the Wii.<br />

Wii Sports Resort

Though it didn't have anywhere near the impact of the original Wii Sports, the sequel is an all-around better package. It's got the stuff you care about from the first game (so, tennis and bowling), plus cool additions like archery and American Gladiators-style swordplay. It's an experience that's definitely of a certain time and place, but after so many years there's a bit of nostalgia tied to flailing your limbs around the living room. Just be sure to put on your Wii Remote wriststraps. They're not joking about that.<br />

<h3>
&nbsp;New Super Mario Bros. Wii

At first, NSMB seemed like kind of a cheap cop-out for Nintendo. New Super Mario Bros. had already been released on the DS, and it was a neat update to . But to bring the simplistic update to the Wii over another Mario Galaxy-style game was sort of disappointing. Until you played it. Somehow Nintendo managed to replicate that old-school Mario feeling while updating it just enough for a modern audience. The highlight is probably the multiplayer mode, which allows you and three friends to roll through every level together. Trying to keep lifelong friendships afloat after "accidentally" throwing someone into a pit of lava is just part of the fun.<br />

<h3>
Xenoblade Chronicles
</h3>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

This game doesn't belong on the Wii. In no way did anyone at any point expect a giant, sweeping JRPG that pleases fans of the genre while at the same time subverting expectations. There's a reason that the secondhand price for Xenoblade skyrocketed after a paltry initial print run. Pretty much everyone wanted to get their hands on the mythical game with the silly Australian voice acting. It's a little more readily available these days, so if you're really feeling it, you can jump in and see for yourself.
